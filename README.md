# Shopping cart

A simple shopping cart example. I used some default starting-out code from
[angular2-webpack-starter][a2ws] but by now I think I've changed most of it. I
was going to write tests, but I decided against that since it's all really just
a big learning experience for me. They would've been useful, but a lot of work
for something that I'm not actually going to actively use.

I learned a bunch of stuff, since it's my first "real" Angular2 project (aside
from the tutorial) and... well, Angular2 is difficult bro. But once you get the
hang of it, it's really cool.

There's two things missing. Styling is first, because it's out-of-scope
busywork and I'm trying to write Angular2 code here, not a beautiful website.
Also don't have any API calls, since I don't actually don't have an API.

There's some documentation strewn throughout the code. The model and event
system are made to be portable and lightly modeled after Backbone's system for
those.
